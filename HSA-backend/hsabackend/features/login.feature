Feature: User Login
  As a user
  I want to log in to my account
  So that I can access my dashboard

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I am on the login page
    # Then I type devuser into the username field
    Then I wait for 30 sec
    # When I enter valid credentials
    # And I click the login button
    # Then I should be redirected to the landing page
